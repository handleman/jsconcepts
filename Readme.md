# concepts of common data structures and algorithms made in js
## this is my playground for training my skills in javascript

It is just a kind of sandbox where I am learning and practising basic concepts and patterns of programming (common data structures, algorithms and etc) - made in javascript.

Nothing low-level or super-complex, just having fun and keeping mind in shape.

### Sections:
1. [Common algorithms implementations ](./algorithms)
1. [Common data structures implementations ](./data-structures)

I will appreciate if you would play with me through your proposals with pull-requests or your comments through 'issues' section.
