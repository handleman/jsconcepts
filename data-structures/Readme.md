## There are examples of common data structures made in js.

In most cases, I am inspired by examples on [code.tutsplus.com](https://code.tutsplus.com/series/data-structures-in-javascript--cms-772)

Currently implemented are :

1. [FIFO queue data structure](./queue.js)
1. [LIFO stack data structure](./stack.js)
